There are 100 lockers in a row, and there are 100 students numbered 1, 2, 3,..., 100. All lockers are closed initially. A change is defined as the locker going from open to close or close to open
Student 1 comes in and changes all lockers with multiple 1 (1, 2, 3,...100) <br>
Student 2 comes in and changes all lockers with multiple 2 (2, 4, 6, ...100) <br>
Student 3 comes in and changes all lockers with multiple 3 (3, 6, 9, ...99) <br>
Student 4 comes in and changes all lockers with multiple 4 (4, 8, 12, ...100) <br>
etc.
All the way to Student 100 changes all lockers with multiple 100 (100) <br>
